Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,"Ran out of PVC material for air baffles/curtains so instead use double layer cardboard from the PAM and FEM shipping boxes.  PVC curtain horizontal across the front under the PAM chassis.  PVC curtain horizontal across the back hanging, via cable ties, from the bottom of the SNAPv2 ladder and reaching down almost to the floor of the enclosure.  Single cardboard sheet vertically on the left side (floor to midpoint of NCM rails and front to 18"" deep), same on right side, almost vertical sheet behind the SNAPv2s (top of SNAPv2 ladder to rear of PAM), and vertical sheet above the SNAPv2 ladder and under the NCM.  vertical panel from floor to rails holding the PAM Chassis located 1"" forward of the rear of the PAM chassis.",,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,"1U fan tray is resting on the top of PAM chassis; cable tied to the front rack rails.  The fan tray is sitting back from the front of the rack by about 2"" in an attempt to align with the SNAPv2 external heatsinks.  It's also shifted left by about 1"" for the same reason.",,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,Has a small cardboard box with 4 D-Sub 9 SNAPv2 power LED gizzmos that can plug into the SNAPv2 end of the D-Sub 9 power cable from the NCM to show if DC power is being delivered to the SNAPv2.  Do Not disconnect the D-Sub 9 cable from the NCM front panel.,,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,"Has 1 spare I2C temperature sensor (for NCM ports, 0, 2, and 3).  Has 1 spare I2C temperature and humidity sensor (for NCM port 1)",,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,"Twelve (12) 6ft (1.8m) blue CAT7 SSTP cables, originally intended just for NCM I2C sensors and Node ID, used for the rear of PAM chassis to the side panel connections.  Numbered with small flags of green electrical tape at both ends.",,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,Minor detail: may have a long (6ft) IEC 60320 C13/C14 VAC power cord for NCM to FEM PSU where a short (3ft) version intended,,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,The fiber optic cables to/from the patch panel and the NCM and SNAPv2s were not installed.  There was no fiber optic cable through the side panel connecting this Node's patch panel to the signal processing container.,,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,"NCM Production SN 6.  SNAPv2s: C000042, C000016, C000014, C000045",,,,,,,,,
