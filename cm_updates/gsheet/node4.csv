Note,2019Nov13,,MRD,"Twelve (12) 6ft (1.8m) blue CAT7 SSTP cables, originally intended just for NCM I2C sensors and Node ID, used for the rear of PAM chassis to the side panel connections.",,,,,,,,,,
Note,2019Nov11,,MRD,"1U Fan tray, Orion Fan tray with 3 fans OA300ST-23,  is (probably) mounted to the front of the rack right above the PAM chassis",,,,,,,,,,
Note,2020Mar03,,MRD,"By reading various documentation, emails, shipping records, etc, it seems as though Node 4 has NCM Production SN 4",,,,,,,,,,
,2021Oct18,,"DD, DMM","WIRING MISTAKE, WR-LEN SFP port 2 was connected to the SC Ref port on the front panel. This meant this lowly WR-Len was acting as a WR Master. And thus it was competing with the WRS-18 (which has the GPS governed 10MHz and 1PPS). Dave D and Dave M found and corrected the wiring mistake.",,,,,,,,,,
,2022Mar06,,"DD, DMM",NCM Production SN 4 misbehaving.  the WR-Len works for switch functions but not timing.  So remove NCM Production SN 4 from Node ID 4.,,,,,,,,,,
,2022Mar06,,"DD, DMM",Install NCM Production SN 21 (from Node ID 23) ,,,,,,,,,,
